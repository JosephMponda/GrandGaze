## §9 Mandatory Critical Enhancements

### §9.1 Clinical Governance Structure
8 RBAC roles with clear ownership + `@role_required` enforcement on every view.

### §9.2 Patient Safety Framework
- Allergy alerts (pharmacy prescribing time)
- Drug-drug interaction warnings (M2M on Drug, critical-level block)
- Breastfeeding/lactation warnings (contraindication flag + sex-based check)
- Critical lab result alerts (auto-fire on save)
- Abnormal vital sign triggers (hard thresholds)
- Pediatric dosing safeguards (dose vs age check; transparent when DOB unknown)
- Duplicate patient record warning (trigram + exact match)
- Time-stamped clinical notes (all Encounter/Lab orders)
- Alert prioritization (critical vs warning levels; warnings can be acknowledged, critical blocks submit)
- Audit logs on every PHI write (AlertEvent now historied)

### §9.3 Legal, Ethical, Compliance Requirements
- Field-level encryption (Fernet-based, via `core/encrypted_fields.py`)
- RBAC with Django Groups
- Audit trails + time-stamped entries
- Consent capture (care/teaching/research)
- Default-deny access pattern

### §9.4 Cybersecurity Requirements
- Secure login (`LoginView` + CSRF middleware; `redirect_authenticated_user=True` prevents session confusion)
- Role-based access control (decorators + permission classes)
- Session timeout (15 min idle, configurable, with 13 min warning via Alpine idle-timer)
- Field-level encryption at rest
- Failed login tracking + account lockout (`django-axes`, 5 attempts → 15 min lock)
- Audit logging on all admin activity
- Custom 404/403/400/500 pages - no internal path/URL pattern disclosure on error
- Logout POST-only enforced; GET redirected safely to login (no bare 405)
- Catch-all URL pattern prevents information leakage on mistyped paths (`/accounts/access` etc.)

### §9.5 Interoperability Standards
- FHIR-inspired endpoint (`/api/interop/`)
- LOINC-ready lab fields
- drf-spectacular OpenAPI docs
- Offline sync queue (`syncapi`)
